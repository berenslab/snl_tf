# Sequential Neural Likelihood estimation - Tensorflow implementation

This repository's aim is to adapt G. Papamakarios' [Sequantial Neural Likelihood](https://github.com/gpapamak/snl/) method from Theano to Tensorflow.

The method heavily depends on the Masked Autoregressive Flow, which has been already translated into Tensorflow in my other [repository](https://github.com/spinaotey/maf_tf).
